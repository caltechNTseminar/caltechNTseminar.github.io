## Abstracts

### _October 2, Qiao He_
**Intersection of Hecke correspondences and a general conjecture**

A classical and beautiful result of Gross-Keating relates the intersection of three Hecke correspondences on the integral model of $X_0(1)\times X_0(1)$ with derivative of certain Eisenstein series. Such result can be regarded as an example of arithmetic Siegel-Weil formula and can serve as an ingredient for an arithmetic Gan-Gross-Prasad formula. In this talk, we consider a variant of this formula for the self-product of $X_0(N)$ where $N$ is square-free and the self-product of Shimura curves respectively. Moreover, we explain how these results confirm a general conjecture for GSpin Shimura varieties with vertex levels. This is joint work with Baiqing Zhu.

### _October 9, Liubomir Chiriac_
**Arithmetic aspects of Hecke traces**

 We use a recent implication of Maedaâ€™s Conjecture to motivate several lines of inquiry into the behavior of traces of Hecke operators. Special focus is placed on uniqueness questions and Lehmer-type problems. To support these investigations, we discuss computational techniques drawn from p-adic analysis and Diophantine approximation. These methods aim to provide both conceptual insights and practical tools for further exploration.

### _October 16, Aaron Landesman_
**Malle's conjecture over function fields**

For $G$ a finite group, Malle's conjecture predicts the asymptotic growth of the
number of $G$ extensions of a fixed global field. In joint work with Ishan Levy,
we compute the asymptotic growth of the number of Galois $G$ extensions of
$\mathbb F_q(t)$, for $q$ sufficiently large and relatively prime to $|G|$.
Time permitting, we may also mention an extension of these methods toward
verifying the Poonen-Rains conjectures about average sizes of Selmer groups of
elliptic curves in quadratic twist families.
