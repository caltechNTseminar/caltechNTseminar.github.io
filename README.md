## Abstracts

### _October 2, Qiao He_
**Intersection of Hecke correspondences and a general conjecture**

A classical and beautiful result of Gross-Keating relates the intersection of three Hecke correspondences on the integral model of $X_0(1)\times X_0(1)$ with derivative of certain Eisenstein series. Such result can be regarded as an example of arithmetic Siegel-Weil formula and can serve as an ingredient for an arithmetic Gan-Gross-Prasad formula. In this talk, we consider a variant of this formula for the self-product of $X_0(N)$ where $N$ is square-free and the self-product of Shimura curves respectively. Moreover, we explain how these results confirm a general conjecture for GSpin Shimura varieties with vertex levels. This is joint work with Baiqing Zhu.

### _October 9, Liubomir Chiriac_
**Arithmetic aspects of Hecke traces**

 We use a recent implication of Maeda’s Conjecture to motivate several lines of inquiry into the behavior of traces of Hecke operators. Special focus is placed on uniqueness questions and Lehmer-type problems. To support these investigations, we discuss computational techniques drawn from p-adic analysis and Diophantine approximation. These methods aim to provide both conceptual insights and practical tools for further exploration.

**Malle's conjecture over function fields**

For $G$ a finite group, Malle's conjecture predicts the asymptotic growth of the
number of $G$ extensions of a fixed global field. In joint work with Ishan Levy,
we compute the asymptotic growth of the number of Galois $G$ extensions of
$\mathbb F_q(t)$, for $q$ sufficiently large and relatively prime to $|G|$.
Time permitting, we may also mention an extension of these methods toward
verifying the Poonen-Rains conjectures about average sizes of Selmer groups of
elliptic curves in quadratic twist families.

**Degree $d$ points on curves**

Given a plane curve $C$ defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, when the genus of the curve is greater than one, Faltings' theorem tells us that the set of rational points on the curve is finite. It is then natural to consider higher degree points, that is, points on this curve defined over fields of degree $d$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. We ask for which natural numbers $d$ are there points on the curve in a field of degree $d$. For positive proportions of certain families of curves, we give results about which degrees of points do not occur. This talk is based on joint work with Andrew Granville.

### _November 19, Shubhodip Mondal_
**Dieudonné theory via cohomology of classifying stacks**

Classically, Dieudonné theory offers a linear algebraic classification of finite group schemes and p-divisible groups over a perfect field of characteristic p>0. In this talk, I will discuss generalizations of this story from the perspective of p-adic cohomology theory (such as crystalline cohomology, and the newly developed prismatic cohomology due to Bhatt--Scholze) of classifying stacks. Time permitting, I will discuss some applications.

### _January 9, Chris Lyons_
**Diophantine problems arising from tetrahedra**

From the humble right triangle stem two rich, classical Diophantine problems: Pythagorean triples and the Congruent Number Problem. Both of these involve the study of rational points on algebraic curves. I'll discuss a higher-dimensional version of these problems leading to certain algebraic surfaces and their rational points. This is joint work with Dinakar Ramakrishnan.
