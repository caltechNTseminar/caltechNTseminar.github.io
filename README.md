## Abstracts

### _October 2, Qiao He_
**Intersection of Hecke correspondences and a general conjecture**

A classical and beautiful result of Gross-Keating relates the intersection of three Hecke correspondences on the integral model of $X_0(1)\times X_0(1)$ with derivative of certain Eisenstein series. Such result can be regarded as an example of arithmetic Siegel-Weil formula and can serve as an ingredient for an arithmetic Gan-Gross-Prasad formula. In this talk, we consider a variant of this formula for the self-product of $X_0(N)$ where $N$ is square-free and the self-product of Shimura curves respectively. Moreover, we explain how these results confirm a general conjecture for GSpin Shimura varieties with vertex levels. This is joint work with Baiqing Zhu.

**Arithmetic aspects of Hecke traces**

 We use a recent implication of Maeda’s Conjecture to motivate several lines of inquiry into the behavior of traces of Hecke operators. Special focus is placed on uniqueness questions and Lehmer-type problems. To support these investigations, we discuss computational techniques drawn from p-adic analysis and Diophantine approximation. These methods aim to provide both conceptual insights and practical tools for further exploration.

**Malle's conjecture over function fields**

For $G$ a finite group, Malle's conjecture predicts the asymptotic growth of the
number of $G$ extensions of a fixed global field. In joint work with Ishan Levy,
we compute the asymptotic growth of the number of Galois $G$ extensions of
$\mathbb F_q(t)$, for $q$ sufficiently large and relatively prime to $|G|$.
Time permitting, we may also mention an extension of these methods toward
verifying the Poonen-Rains conjectures about average sizes of Selmer groups of
elliptic curves in quadratic twist families.

**Manin's conjecture for Châtelet surfaces**

We resolve Manin's conjecture for all Châtelet surfaces over Q (surfaces given by equations of the form x^2 + ay^2 = f(z)) -- we establish asymptotics for the number of rational points of increasing height. The key analytic ingredient is estimating sums of Fourier coefficients of modular forms along polynomial values.

**Affine Schubert varieties are splinters**

Schubert varieties are known to be Frobenius split in positive characteristic by the work of Mehta and Ramanathan. More recently, Bhatt showed that the full flag variety for GL_n is a splinter by entirely different methods. In this talk, we explain these concepts and show how to generalize Bhatt's result to all Schubert varieties for all reductive groups. Our methods apply equally well to affine Schubert varieties, which are of interest in the Langlands program and whose singularities are related to those of Shimura varieties. This is joint work with João Lourenço.

**Local and global biases of modular forms**

Several years ago, I observed that root numbers of modular (new)forms are biased toward +1.  First I will discuss this and analogous local biases for the ramified components of modular forms.  Part of this is joint work with Andrew Knightly.  Then I will discuss how local and global root numbers are correlated with Fourier coefficients at unramified primes, which is a phenomenon now known as murmurations.
